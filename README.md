Information on reaching enlightenment

## Motivation
This project attempts to consolidate - while maintaining brevity - useful resources that one may use as a guide to reaching enlightenment. 

## Build status
Static site is up! 

## Code style
This project uses HTML5 and CSS3.
 
## Features
Cool features include links to free eBooks, very succinct list of yoga poses that is good for the beginner, and a table with useful information about food types, their nutritional rating, and their cost. 

## How to use?
The site has a navbar that allows users to reach home page, books page, yoga page, or nutrition page from any other page on the site. There is also an enrollment option into a [future] paid subscription section. This can be accessed via the home page "Enlighten Me" button.
